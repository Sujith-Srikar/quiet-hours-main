# Netlify Deployment Guide for Quiet Hours

## Quick Fix Summary

The build failure was caused by missing environment variables during the build process. Here's what was fixed:

### 1. Issues Identified

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is not defined` error during build
- Missing `netlify.toml` configuration file
- Next.js configuration not optimized for Netlify
- Environment variables not properly handled during build time

### 2. Files Created/Modified

- ✅ `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
- ✅ `next.config.ts` - Updated for Netlify compatibility
- ✅ `lib/supabaseClient.ts` - Fixed to handle missing env vars during build
- ✅ `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- ✅ `.env.local` - Local development environment variables

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Netlify

Go to your Netlify site dashboard → **Site Settings** → **Environment Variables** and add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_service_role_key
MONGODB_URI=your_actual_mongodb_uri
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_actual_sendgrid_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=your_actual_from_email
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

### Step 2: Netlify Build Settings

In your Netlify site settings:

- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `.next`
- **Node version**: 18.x (set in netlify.toml)

### Step 3: Install Netlify Next.js Plugin

The `netlify.toml` already includes the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin configuration.

### Step 4: Deploy

Push your changes to your repository, and Netlify should now build successfully.

## Local Development

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in your actual environment variable values
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`

## Build Testing

To test the build locally with placeholder values:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: All required environment variables must be set in Netlify's dashboard
2. **API Routes**: Your API routes will be automatically converted to Netlify Functions
3. **Database**: Make sure your MongoDB and Supabase instances are accessible from Netlify's servers
4. **SendGrid**: Ensure your SendGrid API key has proper permissions

## Troubleshooting

If the build still fails:

1. Check Netlify build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure your Supabase and MongoDB instances are publicly accessible
4. Check that all required API keys have proper permissions

## Features Included in Configuration

- ✅ Automatic Next.js optimization for Netlify
- ✅ Security headers
- ✅ Caching optimization for static assets
- ✅ API routes converted to Netlify Functions
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Build error handling (warnings won't stop build)

The build should now complete successfully on Netlify!
